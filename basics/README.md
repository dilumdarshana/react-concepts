# React Concepts

- Vite: To generate projet skeliton

- Router
  - React Router: To create routes and navigate between them. react-router-dom is depricated and react-router-native is best fit for mobile applications.

- Components
  - Functional components: Pure functions that receive props and return UI

- Hooks
  -  useState: Functional component state management
  -  useReducer: Functional level reducer
  -  useContext: Usage of context API
  -  useCallback: Stop rebinding functions on re render
  -  useEffect: Equivalent to component did mount. Trigger after DOM printed to the screen
  -  useLayoutEffect: This will trigger before DOM get printed to the screen
  -  useRef: Can make reference to DOM elements without HTML query selector like document.getElementById(..)
  -  useTransition: Can make expensive executions low priority
  -  useDeferredValue: Replication for debounce
  -  useMemo: To memorise the complex calculations
  -  useId: To generate random ID
  -  use: React API that lets you read the value of a resource like a Promise or context

- Custom hooks: 
  - Rules:
    - Hooks inside hooks are allowed
    - Must be called inside a component. Hook will follow the generic component patterns
  - Examples:
    - useFetch
    - useForm
    - useLocalStorage
    - usePrevious

- Context API

- Error Boundaries

- Other terms
  - Suspense: Use with asynchorinous calls to show something like 'loading...' state. Work inside conditions and loops unlike other hooks

  - Add zod schema validation. zod in a good combination of react-form-hooks
  ```bash
  # add zod and suported module to the project
  pnpm add zod @hookform/resolvers
